## Step 1: Create a Community Group

The first thing you'll want to do is create a community event group for your local Iceberg meetup. Here are some options for this task.

- [**Meetup.com**](https://www.meetup.com): This is the most popular but no free tier for starting an event group. If you are running an event in North America you can leverage the [North American Iceberg Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/north-american-community-run-apache-iceberg-meetups/) by contacting email@icebergcommunity.com to be added as an organizer to add your local events or they can add it for you. Largest benefit of Meetup is discoverability.

- [**Luma**](https://www.lu.ma): A meetup alternative with a generous free tier.

- [**Mobilizon**](https://www.joinmobilizon.org): An open source events page platform, you can deploy your own instance of Mobilizon or use one of many [running instances](https://instances.joinmobilizon.org/instances).

Once your group is created submit it to be added to icebergcommunity.com fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/appjJ1DnEMvRV173g/pagH1oVMGTgzuwGTg/form).

## Step 2 - Create Slack Channel

Join the official [Apache Iceberg Slack Workspace](https://iceberg.apache.org/community/) and join or create a `#meetup` channel for your local area. Once your meetup is submitted we will work to get you a slack channel for your group if the geographical area doesn't have an existing slack channel.

Existing Channels at the time of writing include:

- `#meetup-atlanta`
- `#meetup-austin`
- `#meetup-boston`
- `#meetup-chicago`
- `#meetup-denver`
- `#meetup-nola`
- `#meetup-orlando`
- `#meetup-sanjose`
- `#meetup-seattle`

These are great ways to discuss meeting with community members in your local area and promoting events.

## Step 3 - Schedule Events

Create an event on your event page and post in your local slack channels. Here are some ideas for events:

- **Dev Event**: Targeted towards Apache Iceberg developers, have people who have committed Apache Iceberg talk about their contributions and proposals. Depending on location, these may be better done as virtual events to make easier for Iceberg devs to attend.

- **User Event**: Targeted towards Apache Iceberg users, these events have talks to educate people on Apache Iceberg, talks on Apache Iceberg supporting tools or reviews of usage of Apache Iceberg in production.

- **Social Event**: Dinner, Drinks an event with no speakers for meetup members to socialize and get to know one another.

It is recommended to make it clear which category the event is in via the title of the particular event. Feel free to link to this page in the event description to help people understand the types of events.
